A python game I made for two players. 

# GAME MECHANICS

There are two squares: the red square and the blue square. The red square is controlled with WASD, and the blue square is controlled by the ARROW keys.

The main focus is to not be the square with the little black square inside it. 
At the start of the game, one of the squares will randomly be chosen to have the black square. 

But you must also avoid hitting the white squares. These white squares are randomly generated at the start of the game, and if you want a new map to be generated, then press R.
